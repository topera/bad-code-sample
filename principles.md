SOME CLEAN CODE PRINCIPLES

* General
    * Use IDE refactor tools!
        * Know the shortcuts
    * Separate test code from production code

* Formatting
    * Always use curly braces
    * Indentation
        * Fail fast to avoid haduken code
    * Spacing
    
* Naming
    * Keep consistency
    * Avoid typos
    * Balance between: shortest name possible vs clearest name possible

* Variables scope / Encapsulation
    * Avoid double-negative
    * Use correct type
    * Use constructors/setters properly
    * Expose variables/methods/classe the minor scope possible
    
* Comments
    * Keep same language
    * Remove redundancies
    * Remove useless comments:
        * @author
        * Avoid TODO
        
* Methods/Class
    * Avoid go in and go out many times in a class
    * They are cheap! Create more if necessary
    * Order methods by usage. Getters and setters at the bottom 

* Extra
    * Use "new" language features!! Ex: stream API Java 8
    * Keep SPOT (Single Point of Truth!)
    * Avoid useless variables
    * Use interface instead of classes on variable declarations
